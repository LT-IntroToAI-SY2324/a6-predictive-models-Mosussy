# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value represents the correlation of the x value to the y value. This tells the user whether there is a connecion of cause and effect between our x value to our y value. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
137.46 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I don't think this model's predictions are accurae enough to reliably predict someones blood presure based on their age as there appears to be many outliers on the graph such as the person at their 40s who has a blood pressure of around 160 but theres someone in their 60s who has it closer to 140. We could improve the model by having a larger data set and make sure there is no possible biases embedded in how the data is accumulaed.
