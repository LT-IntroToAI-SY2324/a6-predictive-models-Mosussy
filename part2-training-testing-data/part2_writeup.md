# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
The model make in a2 is more effective than a1 because we can color coordinate more things and it provides labels for what the colors mean on he graph so that a person just passing by can understand without needing knowledge beforehand. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tell you if the two things in the graph are correlated with eachother. Bigger the number the higher sign of correlation. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say our model is not as accurate as people would like it to be since it's off typically by more than 5 blood pressure. The meaning of the values in the context is that as people get older their blood pressure typically goes up.
